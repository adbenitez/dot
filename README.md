This tournament wouldn't be possible without this awesome people:

- Hugot: provided email accounts for the bots.

- Echedey: provided servers to host the bots.

- ERSUS: donated money for the winners and helped spreading the word.

- And some others anonymous people that preferred not to be mentioned.

**Thanks you very much, you rock!**
